<p>Learn new pieces or look to re-arrange old favourites along with other players of similar abilities. “I’ve learned more in the last five minutes than I have in the previous two years” (Roger Wainwright).</p>
<p>Rekindle your enthusiasm for playing. “This has really fired my enthusiasm to play again. What a great time! (Dave Sumpner).</p>
<p>You will learn how to play a range of pieces and also have the opportunity to perform in front of an audience, playing  along with professionals. “It’s taken me four days to come down to earth. What a fantastic experience” (Jem Smith).</p>
<p>Build up your confidence to attempt pieces that you never felt able to attempt previously. “Had a superb time, thoroughly enjoyed it and would be keen to join in again. In the meantime if you know anybody else looking for a new band member, please let me know. ( Carl Chambers).</p>
<p>Enjoy lovely food and drink in comfortable, friendly surroundings. “What a great weekend; one of the best.  Great company, great location, great food, great tuition and most of all, just great fun”.  (Peter Dickinson).</p>
